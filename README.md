# A phonetic dictionary used for speech-related tasks

## Problem: 
- In VIetnamese, there is no "cmudict"-like dictionary for phonetic embedding task in speech regconition/synthesis

## My solution
- This dictionary can be used for Vietnamese phonetic embedding task like CMU dictionary - but use IPA symbols instead of ARPABET ones.
- This dictionary has the phoneme of Vietnamese word and even English circumstances

## Reference
- Special thank to https://github.com/v-nhandt21/Viphoneme - my dictionary is created based on their work
